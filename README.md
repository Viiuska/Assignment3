Assignment 3

1. Create multiple databases (at least three) that have some dummy data within them (at least four tables with five data entities in each minimum).  
Any database type is allowed (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, SQL Server, etc.)  
Have the databases have at least some of the same relations (tables), showing fragmentation and replication of data.  
2. Create a frontend program that can access the databases (for example using Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.)   
3. Within the frontend, have the user be able to choose a location and print data from the database based on the chosen location  
   The database used would be changed based on the location.
